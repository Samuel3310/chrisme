                  We had poor graphics and very little content and structure for
                  this project, but Damian helped us to design an outstanding
                  online shop by creating amazingness out of nothing. The
                  bespoke design for Desktops, Tablets and Smartphones was
                  delivered in such a way that our developers were able to
                  convert it into HTML/CSS in no time. When you work with Damian
                  you work with a professional designer who understands the
                  limitations and implications between design and code.
